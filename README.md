GOALS
• Determine if there are people at the pedestrian crossing.
• Check if there are cars approaching the pedestrian crossing.
• Count the number of cars in the parking lot. 
• Count the number of people who have crossed the pedestrian crossing.

//////////////

DATA 
COLLECTION 
• Using specialized software, I collected photographs from a live camera feed at intervals of 12 minutes.
• A total of 876 photos were taken during the 10 days of data collection.

//////////////

ANNOTATION OF PHOTOS
• In the photos, I searched and noted two objects: cars and people.

//////////////

LIMITATIONS OF THIS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

• AI currently only works with 1 camera.
• In bad weather conditions, the results are often incorrect.

//////////////

ADAPTATION IN EVERYDAY LIFE

• Pedestrians, knowing that a vehicle is approaching, will feel safer in crosswalks with poor visibility.
• The position of pedestrians could be sent to self-driving cars and they could better assess the traffic situation.
• An app that shows where you can park your car.
